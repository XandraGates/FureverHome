        <h1>About Furever Home<h1>
  <p>Here at Furever Home, we believe that a home is for life - not a temporary resting stop. We seek to rehome our animals within loving, stable environments. While we specialise in rehoming cats and dogs, we often have a selection of rodents and birds in need of a family. To find out more about our current host of animals, please get in touch. You can contact us <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <h3>What makes a good 'Furever Home'?</h3>
  <p>In addition to a stable and loving environment, we seek to rehome our animals with a family that can best fulfil their individual needs. For example, if animals of a nervous nature are often better suited in households where everyone is over the age of 16. We always carry out home inspections as an indication of suitability.</p>
  <h3>Are you hiring / looking for volunteers?</h3>
  <p>We are currently not seeking any more staff. Please check in with your other local shelters though!</p>
  <h3>Where can I find the 'Furever Home'?</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, Furever Home does not exist. It was created for a coding assignment. There are, however, many wonderful charities out there that seek to rehome animals. This one was inspired by <a href="https://fureverhaus.org/" target="_blank">Nash's Furever Haus</a>, which seeks to connect elderly dogs with families, as well as providing them with the love and medical care many so desperately need during their stay.
  <h3>Can I make a donation to support this organisation?</h3>
